# Homework #2

## Instructions

1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* arrow functions - an ES6 shortcut for creating a function
	* state - the current value of variables & other data
	* constructor - a special method for creating an object in a class
	* setState - setState with a callback function and setState with an object passed in
	* .bind - a method used on a function to determine which object it's 'this' refers to
	* functional components vs class components
	* onClick - refers to an event where a mouse button is clicked on an element

2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called clock. `create-react-app clock`
	* Navigate into /clock and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<NavBar />` and a `<Clock />` component.
	* Create a file called `NavBar.js` and a file called `Clock.js`
	* `<NavBar />` and `<Clock />` will both be React components.  `<NavBar />` should display the title of your page in a larger font.
	* `<Clock />` will display a clock that updates every second.  (You will need to use the `Date` object.)
	* `Date` example: `const now = new Date(); now.getHours(); now.getDay(); now.getMinutes(); now.getSeconds(); etc.`
	* Create a clock that updates every second. JavaScript's `setInterval(cb, miliseconds)` function allows you to specify code that runs after a set time.
	* Style `<Clock />` and try to make it look nice.
