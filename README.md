# Homework #1

## Instructions

1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* let - block scoped alternative to 'var' that is mutable
	* const - block scoped alternative to 'var' that is immutable
	* ES6 Classes - a new & improved way of writing constructor functions
	* import/export - used to transfer data from one file to another (or many others)
	* JSX - a way to write HTML inside of javascript
	* this.props - properties of the current component that can be passed to child components


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* Run: `npm install -g create-react-app`
	* Create a boilerplate React app called Profile. `create-react-app profile`
	* Navigate into /profile and run the command: `npm start`
	* Your `<App />` component will render a `<NavBar />` and a `<Body />` component.
	* Create a file called `NavBar.js` and a file called `Body.js`
	* `<NavBar />` and `<Body />` will both be React components.  `<NavBar />` should display the title of your page in a larger font.
	* `<Body />` will display some information about yourself.
	* Try adding an image, some text, and some links to your github profile.
	* For the content in `<Body />` try to break things down into their own components as much as you can.  The purpose of this exercise is to practice creating basic components.  You should be very comfortable with the basic syntax of creating React components before the next lesson.
